### Instructions

Clone or download this repository to an OSX machine and you can try the application yourself by running the binary /bin/wanderers-release.app (double-click or Cmd+DownArrow to run).

While the app is running, clicking with the mouse/touchpad spawns targets that wanderers are attracted to. Scene can be switched by pressing any key on the keyboard.


### Info

Made with OpenFrameworks v0.11.0.

Wanderers utilizes an addon called ofxPlayground, which I wrote during the course. It provides scene switching and drawing functions. The addon version compatible with Wanderers is stored in local_addons to minimize chance of future breakage. If the addon gets developed further in the future, releases will be published in:
