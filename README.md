### Info

WANDERERS is the final project for the Aalto University course DOM-E5106 Generative Media Coding by Emil Lindfors. It was made in Spring 2020. Technologies used: C++ and OpenFrameworks (v0.11.0).

Wanderers utilizes an OpenFrameworks addon called ofxPlayground, which I wrote during the course. It provides scene switching and drawing functions. The addon version compatible with Wanderers is stored in local_addons to minimize chance of future breakage. If the addon gets developed further in the future, releases will be published in:
